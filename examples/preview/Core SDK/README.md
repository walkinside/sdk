Core SDK Examples
=================

## Using Example Projects

To use examples in this folder, install COMOS Walkinside 10.2 SP1 64-bit
or 32-bit in "Just Me" mode ("All Users" will not work), then open 
`CoreSdkExamplesFor64BitWalkinside.sln` or `CoreSdkExamplesFor32BitWalkinside.sln` 
accordingly in Visual Studio 2012 or higher.

Example projects are configured in such a way as to automatically reference
SDK assemblies from your Walkinside installation. Also, build output will be
written directly to your Walkinside's plug-ins folder. That way you can
compile example plug-ins, open your Walkinside and immediately examples in the
plug-in list.
