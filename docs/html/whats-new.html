<div class="textblock"><p>As this is a Service Pack release, it maintains compatibility guarantees relative to 10.2. You can find details of those guarantees in <a class="el" href="policy.html">API Compatibility Policy</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that this release is expected to be the last service pack before 10.3. When 10.3 is released, we will take the opportunity to remove any or all deprecated API members, according to the <a class="el" href="policy.html">API Compatibility Policy</a>.</p>
<h2>Policy Change Notice </h2>
<p>We would like to let you know in advance that our <a class="el" href="policy.html">API Compatibility Policy</a> is going to be revised in the next release. Our current policy was designed with much shorter release cycles in mind. In practice it forces us to keep irrelevant APIs for many years, slowing down innovation and new development.</p>
<p>The upcoming changes will address that and will allow us to have shorter deprecation and removal periods.</p>
<p>Until the new policy is in place we commit to the guarantees provided by the current version of the policy.</p>
