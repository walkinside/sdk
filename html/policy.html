<div class="textblock"><p>This is part of general COMOS Walkinside Compatibility Policy, concerned specifically with API compatibility.</p>
<p><b>Goal of this document</b>: to establish clear rules on what customers can expect in terms of compatibility and what minimum compatibility R&amp;D commits to maintain.</p>
<p><b>Applies to</b>: official standard releases of COMOS Walkinside.</p>
<p>This document mentions 2 directions of compatibility:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli"><b>Backward compatibility</b>: refers to situation when software is combined with an older component or data than itself.</p>
<p class="startli">Example: a SimCity binary released for Windows 95 is launched on Windows 7. If it runs correctly, Windows 7 is said to be backward compatible with Windows 95 with respect to SimCity.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><b>Forward compatibility</b>: refers to situation when software is combined with a more recent component or data than itself.</p>
<p class="startli">Example: a document created by Microsoft Word 2010 is opened with Microsoft Word 2007. If it opens correctly, Word 2007 is said to be forward compatible with Word 2010 with respect to document format.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md4"></a>
API Compatibility</h1>
<p>API compatibility refers to the ability of API client, which was created for some API release X, to be run on API release X', where X' is more recent or less recent than X. For example, creating a viewer plug-in or a builder for 7.0 and running it in either 10.2 or 6.2.</p>
<p>For APIs the following kinds of compatibility are distinguished:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Binary compatibility</b>: a client component built against one release of API works with another release of API without being rebuilt.</li>
<li><b>Source compatibility</b>: a client component built against one release of API works with another release of API if it is rebuilt against that release.</li>
<li><b>No compatibility</b>: a client component built against one release of API does not work with another release of API; rebuilding it requires modification of component's source code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Technical note: it is possible to have binary compatibility, but not source compatibility, and vice versa. One example is C# named parameters: renaming parameters is a backward-compatible, but source-incompatible change.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md5"></a>
API Support Levels</h1>
<p>This policy establishes different API support levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>None</li>
<li>Preview</li>
<li>Official</li>
<li>Deprecated</li>
<li>Discontinued</li>
</ul>
<p>"Preview" APIs do not get any compatibility guarantees. "Best effort" is provided to avoid gratuitous incompatibility.</p>
<p>"Official" APIs get higher compatibility guarantees:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli"><b>Limited backward compatibility with immediate previous release</b>:</p>
<p class="startli">Each new Major.Minor.SPX release maintains binary compatibility relative to the immediately preceding release, except for API members that were deprecated the preceding (or older) release. Clients that used such deprecated API members may become broken; clients that did not use them are not affected.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><b>Removal of deprecated API members only after grace period of at least one release</b>:</p>
<p class="startli">Any Major.Minor.SPX release may remove or change any API members that were marked as deprecated in any previous release. If this happens, compatibility is broken for clients that use those deprecated members. "Best
  effort" is provided to avoid gratuitous breakage of compatibility. If a deprecated member is not changed/removed in this Major.Minor.SPX release, it may still be changed/removed in any subsequent release.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><b>Friendly deprecation of API members</b>:</p>
<p class="startli">Any release of at least Service Pack level may mark any API members as deprecated. "Best effort" is provided to point user to an alternative non-deprecated way to achieve same functionality as the one being deprecated.</p>
</li>
<li>Source compatibility is maintained on a "best effort" basis, but is not guaranteed.</li>
</ul>
<p>API that becomes "official" in some release does not have to maintain compatibility with previous releases, as they were just "preview".</p>
<p>"Deprecated" APIs are official APIs that are being phased out. Normally there is some alternative API to achieve same tasks. Deprecated APIs can be expected to be discontinued in the closest SP0 release. If you rely on an API that has been deprecated and you do not find a good alternative</p><ul>
<li>please raise your concerns at <a href="https://github.com/walkinside/sdk/issues">https://github.com/walkinside/sdk/issues</a> or otherwise contact us.</li>
</ul>
<p>"Discontinued" APIs do not get any guarantees or support and are not actually considered as APIs anymore.</p>
<p>Like any complex software, Walkinside has a number of internal interfaces between components. Those are not considered APIs and their use by 3rd-parties technically is reverse engineering, so is unsupported (support level "None"). These are some interfaces known to be internal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Viewer SDK's JavaScript interface;</li>
<li>Server's web-service interface;</li>
<li>any events passed via Viewer SDK's <code>IVREventManager</code>;</li>
<li>any public members placed in <code>*.Private.*</code> namespace of SDK assemblies;</li>
<li>any public members outside of SDK assemblies.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md6"></a>
Recognized Walkinside APIs</h1>
<p>As of version 10.2, Walkinside provides several APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Viewer SDK API</b>: intended for developing Walkinside plug-ins and alternative Walkinside viewer-like applications.</li>
<li><b>Data SDK API</b>: intended for accessing Walkinside project data in data-centric and non-interactive scenarios.</li>
<li><b>Core SDK API</b>: intended to augment Viewer SDK API with custom model rendering capabilities.</li>
<li><b>Virtual Room Client Library API</b>: intended for developing Virtual Room agents that can observe other participants, drive avatars and communicate via custom messages.</li>
<li><b>Viewer SDK HTTP Automation API</b>: local HTTP endpoint intended to give HTML-based applications a limited way to drive Walkinside camera via hyperlinks.</li>
<li><b>CLI (command-line interfaces)</b>: intended for batch scripting and automation. Provided by the following applications:<ul>
<li>Viewer</li>
<li>Builder for PDMS, batch mode</li>
<li>Builder Tool</li>
<li>MicroStation Exporter plug-in, batch mode</li>
<li>PDS Exporter plug-in, batch mode</li>
<li>Project Data Transfer Tool</li>
<li>Portal Client Tool</li>
<li>Virtual Room Service</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As of 10.2 SP4 (mid-2018), Walkinside APIs are assigned the following status:</p>

"Empty Shell" Deprecation</h1>
<p>In very rare cases it is not possible for us to keep the deprecated API working. In such situations the API can be left in place, but all implementation behind it removed.</p>
<p>This happened in the past with Scripting functionality, which was removed from the product. Scripting was also exposed in Viewer SDK API and those APIs became empty shells, doing nothing when called. That way the SDK clients at least would not fail to load due to removed interfaces.</p>
<p>This measure is reserved as a last resort for special situations.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md8"></a>
Examples</h1>
<p>Below are examples of deprecation and removal of API members. For the purpose of examples, this sequence of releases is used:</p>
<ul>
<li>10.3</li>
<li>10.3 SP1</li>
<li>10.3 SP2</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md9"></a>
Example 1.</h2>
<p>Walkinside 10.3 SP1 marks <code>IVRSpam</code> member of Viewer SDK as deprecated. It offers <code>IVRBacon</code> as alternative for some of <code>IVRSpam</code> functionality and just drops remaining functionality. Viewer SDK plug-ins are recommended to stop using <code>IVRSpam</code> and use <code>IVRBacon</code> instead.</p>
<p>Walkinside 10.3 SP2 decides to drop <code>IVRSpam</code>, at which point it is removed from API.</p>
<p>Viewer SDK plug-ins that used IVRSpam are forced to be updated to use <code>IVRBacon</code> and to be rebuilt and redeployed.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md10"></a>
Example 2.</h2>
<p>Walkinside 10.3 SP1 adds new member <code>VRHam</code> to .NET bindings of Data SDK API.</p>
<p>Walkinside 10.3 SP2 decides <code>VRHam</code> is not useful anymore and removes it. This breaks compatibility for <code>VRHam</code> users, but no deprecation or alternative is required, because Data SDK API is in "preview" status.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md11"></a>
API Versioning</h1>
<p>APIs follow semantic versioning scheme (<a href="http://semver.org">http://semver.org</a>) to indicate to clients when there is compatibility breakage.</p>
<p>For example, removing deprecated item from "official" API means that API version must jump to the next major version number. API versions necessarily differ from software versions. </p>
