# COMOS Walkinside SDK

COMOS Walkinside is a [powerful 3D real-time viewer for large complex models](http://walkinside.com).
It was designed to be extensible from the beginning, with a wide range of APIs available to developers. 

This repository is a hub for learning how to develop on top of Walkinside.
It is also the place to discuss SDK matters with Walkinside core developers,
propose improvements and get in touch with other SDK users.
